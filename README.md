# 🖼️ Object Detection using Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **Object Detection** model using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The model leverages deep learning frameworks to detect and classify objects in images or videos. It is structured for easy understanding and extensibility, making it suitable for research and real-world applications.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Pretrained Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD.  
✅ **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adaptable for training on custom datasets.  
✅ **Image & Video Processing**: Supports both static images and real-time video streams.  
✅ **Bounding Box Visualization**: Displays detected objects with labeled bounding boxes.  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Step-by-step execution for easy learning.
